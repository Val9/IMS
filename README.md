IMShooter Source Code (UnrealScript)

This is the UnrealScript source code to IMShooter, available on the iOS App Store 
( http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/imshooter/id508536141 )

I do not consider this code perfect, although it does exactly what I want it to do,
however I only started out with UnrealScript two months ago and I'm a terrible coder
in general.

It should however provide you with a good sense of how UnrealScript works and how
to do simple things on iOS without using UTGame classes.

Feel free to use this little gift of mine as a starting point and inspiration 
for your own future endeavours but treat it with respect.

Brb grabban' a beer.
